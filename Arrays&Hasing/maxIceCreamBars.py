class Solution(object):
    """
    Algorithm:
    1. Sort the costs array in asending order
    2. Initialise the count to 0
    3. Iterate through the sorted cost array
        4. ckeck if the cost at index is <= coins
            4.a. if yes, increment the count and deduct the price(i.e cost of icecream) from the remaining coins balance
            4.b. else, break from the loop (it means boy cannot buy any icreams as remaining other are costly sicne they are in asc order)
    5.return count
